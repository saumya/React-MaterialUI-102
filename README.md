React And MaterialUI
==============================

Firstly the versions used are as below.

Versions
--------------
 - material-ui : ^0.15.0-alpha.1
 - react : ^15.0.0-rc.1
 - react-router : ^2.0.0

Note
----------
It seems that the `onTouchTap` event is not working. So, currently I use
 - onClick : for desktop
 - onTouchEnd : for mobile


Bug

There seems to be a Bug on [React 15.0.0-rc-1][react-bug-1]
