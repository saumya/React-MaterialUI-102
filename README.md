React And MaterialUI
==============================

Firstly the versions used are as below.

Versions:
--------------
 - material-ui : ^0.15.0-alpha.1
 - react : ^15.0.0-rc.1
 - react-router : ^2.0.0

It seems that the `onTouchTap` event is not working. So, currently I use
 - onClick : for desktop
 - onTouchEnd : for mobile
